      question: 'What even is BotBuddy? Is it for someone like me?',
      answer: 'Totally! BotBuddy is your behind-the-scenes tech partner. We build AI bots and automation tools that help businesses like yours handle tasks you probably donâ€™t love doing â€” like follow-ups, sending emails, segmenting customers, recovering abandoned carts, and even talking to customers with voice bots.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to be a techie to use this?',
      answer: 'Nope! You donâ€™t need to write a single line of code. Weâ€™ve designed everything to be plug-and-play â€” choose a template, connect your accounts, and youâ€™re off. And if you ever get stuck, weâ€™re right here to help. Itâ€™s automation, made beginner-friendly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can this really help me reduce costs or make more money?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. Most of our clients either: a) Cut down on manual staff hours or b) Recovered sales they were missing before. Whether it`s an AI voice bot calling customers who abandoned carts, or smart campaigns triggered at the perfect moment â€” our bots help you earn more while doing less.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are voice bots and why should I care?',
      answer: 'Great question. Voice bots are like your 24/7 call agents. They can call customers, follow up, remind them about deliveries or sales, or collect reviews â€” all in natural human-like voice. No burnout, no break time. Theyâ€™re powerful, cost-effective, and honestlyâ€¦ kind of magical when you see them in action.',
    },
    {
      question: "Can I try it before paying?",
      answer: 'Yes! We offer and introductory call and a 7-day free trials on all our bots â€” no pressure. Try out the bots, test the automations, and only stay if youâ€™re impressed (which, weâ€™re pretty sure you will be ðŸ˜‰).',
